In this exercise of Free Code Camp's daily coding challenge I have tried to solve a Tribonacci sequence problem in two popular languages: Python and JavaScript.
Here is what I learnt in terms of differences and similarities:
1. Similarities
   - Both languages call for a formation of a function
   - The logic/algorithm is virtually the same (check for length provided by the user, react based on the input, add the previous 3 numbers and append to the existing sequence)
   - They follow the same sequence of positioning of code like where and when the variables are declared and where and when for loop starts for instance
2. Differences
   - The differences lie in the syntax, Python terminates a clause with : while JavaScript with a ;
   - Python directly understands the calling of array based on indexing whereas JavaScript needs an explicit .slice to chop off the starter sequence.
   - Python uses append to add the next number in the sequence while Java uses push (it is like like learning Japanese and Spanish, agua vs mizoo both say water but sounds different)
   - Python is more straight forward in printing (just say print like a natural language) while Java needs to be told console.log (sounds a little more computery)
Hope you enjoyed it :)
